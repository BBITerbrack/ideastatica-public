# Version Tagging in Our Repository

### Official Releases vs. Main Branch: 
The commit that represents our official release may not always be the latest one in the main branch. Official releases are marked by tags.

### Tag Names and Messages: 
Each official release is tagged with its version number. This tag not only indicates the release but also contains a message specifying whether it's a beta version or a production release.

### Selecting the Right Version:
We encourage you to pay close attention to the version tags. Whether you're using our code for testing (beta) or deploying it in a production environment, selecting the correct version tag is crucial. This ensures compatibility and optimizes the effectiveness of your development endeavors.

### Useful commands
- **git tag** for list all tags
- **git checkout 'tagname'** to checkout to specific commit by tag name
- **git show 'tag name'** to show tag information like message etc.
